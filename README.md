# Sensor data is streamed to Firebase's realtime database and simultaneously saved to a CSV file. The CSV file is then automatically uploaded to Firebase Storage and deleted from the local device. This process is fully automated, allowing for seamless uploading and downloading of data
from Firebase. By utilizing Firebase's real-time database and storage features, data can be easily accessed and managed
from any device with internet access.
